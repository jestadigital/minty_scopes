What
====

A collection of handy `scope`s that you should be able to use in just about any model.

Why
===

Named scopes turn ugly finders into pretty ones.

Howto
=====

Install the gem from Gemcutter

    gem install minty_scopes

Specify the gem dependency in your `environment.rb`:

    config.gem 'minty_scopes'

In any model, you can get the scopes by extending the module:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend MintyScopes
    end

Scopes
======

Scopes are grouped into modules by functionality. If you only want some scopes, feel free to extend only the modules you want: `extend MintyScopes::Timestamps`

### Associations ###

    with(:comments)       #=> :joins => :comments, :group => 'posts.id' (only posts with comments)
    without(:comments)    #=> :joins => 'LEFT JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id', 
                          #   :conditions => {'comments.id' => nil}
    including(:comments)  #=> :include => [:comments]

### Except ###

    except(post)              #=> [ 'posts.id NOT IN (?)', post ]
    except(post, post)        #=> [ 'posts.id NOT IN (?)', [post, post] ]
    except(post_collection)   #=> [ 'posts.id NOT IN (?)', post_collection ]

### Order ###

    newest      #=> { :order => 'created_at DESC', :limit => per_page || limit }
    newest(20)  #=> { :order => 'created_at DESC', :limit => 20 }
    oldest      #=> { :order => 'created_at ASC',  :limit => per_page || limit }
    oldest(20)  #=> { :order => 'created_at ASC',  :limit => 20 }

### Timestamps ###

    created_on(date)  #=> :created_at => (date.beginning_of_day..date.end_of_day)
    modified_on(date) #=> :modified_at => (date.beginning_of_day..date.end_of_day)
